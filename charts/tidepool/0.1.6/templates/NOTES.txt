Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm get {{ .Release.Name }}

{{ if .Values.global.secrets.create }}
The Tidepool services rely on various secrets to encrypt and decrypt
data. You need to provide those secrets.

Some of those secrets are provided by or shared with third parties
(e.g. Dexcom, Mailchimp, UCSF).  You need to supply these in the
form of Kubernetes Secret manifests.  If you do not provide them,
then the associated services are not available.  Look in the
deployment files for secrets that are marked optional.

Other secrets are for used only within your Tidepool environments.
You have just generated those with Helm.

Each time you install this Helm chart, a new set of secrets are
generated.  This is fine, IF you throw away all you data between
installations.  However, if you persist your data, then you need
to keep the same secrets from one installation to the next.

You may generate secrets using this helm chart and save them to a file with:

$ helm template -f values.yaml . | yq 'filter(.kind == "Secret")' >secrets.yaml

To load the secret file, in the directory where you stored your secrets, run:

  kubectl apply -f secrets.yaml

{{ end }}

Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm get {{ .Release.Name }}

{{ if .Values.generateSharedSecrets }}

The tidepool service relies on various secrets to encrypt and decrypt
data.  Within Tidepool, the service retrieves these secrets from
an Amazon service.  If you are running locally, you need to provide
those secrets.

Some of those secrets are provided by or shared with third parties.
You need to supply these in the form of Kubernetes Secret manifests.
Others are for Tidepool internal use. You have just generated those
with Helm.  

I see that you generated new internal secrets.
Each time you install this Helm chart, a new set of
secrets are generated.  This is fine, if you throw away all you
data between installations.  However, if you persist your data,
then you need to keep the same secrets from one helm installation
to the next.

To do that, after the first successful helm installation, you will
need to run 

kubectl get secrets server-secrets -o yaml

and save the results into a file.  These are the secrets that helm
generated for you.  If you rerun helm install later, you will need
to use these secrets and NOT the secrets that it would generate.
To run off secret generation, add the setting when running `helm
install`:

  --set "generateSharedSecrets=false"

To load the secret file, run:

  kubectl apply -f server-secret.yaml
{{ end }}

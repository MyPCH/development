Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm get {{ .Release.Name }}

{{ if .Values.generateSharedSecrets }}
I see that you generated new shared secrets.

The tidepool service relies on various secrets to encrypt and decrypt
data.  Within Tidepool, the service retrieves these secrets from
an Amazon service.  If you are running locally, you need to provide
those secrets.

Each time you install this helm chart, a new set of
secrets are generated.  This is fine, if you throw away all you
data between installations.

However, if you persist your data, then you need to keep the same
secrets from one helm installation to the next.

To do that, after the first successful helm installation, you will
need to run `kubectl get secrets server-secrets -o yaml` and save
the results into a file.  These are the secrets that helm generated
for you.  If you rerun helm later, you will need to use these secrets
and NOT the secrets that it would generate.  To run off secret
generation, add the setting 

  --set "generateSharedSecrets=false"

when running helm.  To load the secret file, run

  kubectl apply -f server-secret.yaml
{{ end }}

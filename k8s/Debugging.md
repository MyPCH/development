## How to Debug Your Kubernetes Services

Debugging Kubernetes services can be as easy as debugging services running locally with [Telepresence](https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/overview) or [Squash](https://squash.solo.io/). 

#### Telepresence
With Telepresence, you run and debug *one* service locally that *appears to Kubernetes to be running in your Kubernetes cluster*.

From the developer:

>Presence is an open source tool that lets you run a single service locally, while connecting that service to a remote Kubernetes cluster. This lets developers working on multi-service applications to:
>
> * Do fast local development of a single service, even if that service depends on other services in your cluster. Make a change to your service, save, and you can immediately see the new service in action.
>
> * Use any tool installed locally to test/debug/edit your service. For example, you can use a debugger or IDE!
>
> * Make your local development machine operate as if it's part of your Kubernetes cluster. If you've got an application on your machine that you want to run against a service in the cluster -- it's easy to do.

#### Squash
With Squash, all services run in your Kubernetes, but *appear to your debugger to run locally*.

From the developer:

>Squash brings the power of modern debuggers to developers of microservice apps. Squash bridges between the apps running in a Kubernetes environment (without modifying them) and the IDE. Users are free to choose which containers, pods, services or images they are interested in debugging, and are allowed to set breakpoints in their codes, follow values of their variables on the fly, step through the code while jumping between microservices, and change these values during run time.

>With Squash, you can:
> * Debug running microservices
> * Debug container in a pod
> * Debug a service
> * Set breakpoints
> * Step through code
> * View and modify values of variables
> â€¦anything you could do with a regular debugger, and more!
